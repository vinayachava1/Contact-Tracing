### Markdown Cells
1. **Introduction:** Explains the purpose of the notebook and the libraries used.
2. **Data Analysis:** Discusses the approach for analyzing the data with visualization.

### Code Cells
1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Loads necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
   - Configures Matplotlib for inline display.
2. **Load Data:**
   - Reads JSON data from a file named "livedata.json" into a DataFrame, you can find that [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/livedata.json)
   - Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, showing columns like `id`, `timestamp`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a scatterplot.
   - The scatterplot visualizes data points with `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates, categorized by the `id`.
### Purpose:
This contact tracing feature is designed to help monitor the spread of infectious diseases by tracking interactions between individuals. It's a critical tool for public health surveillance and response strategies.

## Functionality
1. **Real-Time Tracking:** The system captures and updates the geographical position of users in real-time.
2. **Contact Detection:** By analyzing the collected data, the system identifies when two or more individuals are within a certain distance for a specified duration, suggesting a potential contact event.
3. **Historical Data Analysis:** Allows health officials to access historical location data to identify trends and potential hotspots of infection.

## Installation and Setup
To integrate this contact tracing feature into your system, follow these steps:
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed along with the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
